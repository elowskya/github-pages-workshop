So I guess this is the part where I tell you that I like
yoga, dogs, and craft beer...

Let's not do that:

* Instead, let's be a little real, but not get too comfortable.

My background is non traditional. I'm a first generation college student. I initially attended a Community College, and I took classes that interested me including: Business, Sciences, Math, and of course Yoga. When it came time to finish, I chose Kinesiology since I figured every one needs to move in order to live (or eat - I also considered Dietetics). I graduated from Grand Valley State University with a Bachelor's of Science degree. The highlights of my undergraduate program include an internship with the Special Olympics basketball program and an intership in Cardiovascular Rehabilitation. Thereafter, I worked as a Fitness Program Director and a Corporate Wellness Program Manager. It was about this point in my career that I realized I was becoming an expert in program optimization and measurable key performance indicator's in my field; however, I also realized that long term, I was hungry to keep learning and challenging myself.

It was bold, but I quit my corporate management position and traveled to California to enroll in a Full Stack Coding Bootcamp. This bootcamp was the hardest thing I have ever done. I am used to being the role model and person where everyone asks for advice, and for the first time, I was not at the top of my class. Despite everything, I didn't give up; I continued to practice writing code, I watched videos, and I read blog posts from other developers daily. I even went through almost all of my assignments from school and resubmitted them. On that note, I am very grateful to the instructor and TA's for their patience.

Ultimately, web development is a skill. There's a technical aspect that takes time to acclimate your brain in regards to thinking in terms of objects, loops, and the process of data flow. Even writing code for hours takes time to build mental endurance. After I completed my Coding Bootcamp, I quickly found a couple of clients who wanted website work. Freelance client work is also a skill which involves an incredible amount of communication, organization, and drive to find answers in order to troubleshoot your own code. I can definitely say that I have learned a lot. I still take classes (online and in person) and each project I take on, I learn something new and become better. 

I am excited to share this part of my journey with you.
