## Don't Become a Software Engineer

When someone tells me that they are thinking about pursuing a career change to software development, my first reaction is don't.There are many other jobs out there and you likely have attended college, have obligations, and have a day job. You have already established a way to earn income and have a routine in place. Why would you want to change this?

**Top 3 Reasons Someone Might Think It's a Good Idea to Become a Software Developer:**

*1. There is "prestige" associated with being a software developer.*

**Answer:** False, have you ever spent a day riding your public transportation system? Do you know how to find the right bus stop and get across a city? Have you ever observed the drivers’ care to move people back and make room for wheelchair bound passengers and buckle them in? There is a lot of respect and “prestige” that goes into the public service sector as well as private and the job(s) that you might already be doing. We each play our part in the role of order, structure, and consistency in what we perceive as a daily routine or norm.

*2. Software developers make good money.*

**Answer:** True, but have you talked to a software developer lately? Ask them the projects that they are working on. Do you have any idea of what they are talking about? Think really hard about this, because software developers basically speak and write in another language and use a ton of logic thinking and problem solving. If you're thinking this is a good idea based on salary alone, then I'd highly recommend strategizing ways to reduce spending, pay off high interest debt, and look into avenues to generate income which is a process, but probably more practical.

*3. If I take a bootcamp or some online courses, I will get a job as a software developer right away.*

**Answer:** False, you still have to network, apply, interview, and be picked like everyone else.

Bootcamps have become really popular with the demand for software developers, but it's called a Bootcamp for a reason. There is a lot of technical material to cover which really scratches the surface of software development. Also, they vary in their course material and instructors, so you may be learning one stack, but a job might require another stack for a client. Even more so, what else have you worked on beside assignments the instructor gave you? You will need to invest additional time on your own learning, building projects, and networking because a Bootcamp is a starting point and does not necessarily make you a competitive job applicant.

*Despite everything mentioned, becoming a software developer is really about being a good fit for the long run.*

**Top Skills That May Indicate This Could Be Good:**

1. You value learning, because you will be doing this every single day
2. You like taking initiative to find answers to your questions
3. You like logic and problem solving
4. You value work that is not repetitious
5. You like collaborating with others
6. You are invested in doing this for a very long time
7. You are willing to teach others
8. You are willing to comment and write guides so others can read and understand your code
9. You are patient

Switching careers is tough. It is like living two parallel lives. Many of us can’t just quit our day jobs, so we have to keep the life/career that we initially built going during the day and at night time practice coding and building this new career around our other obligations until we can make the jump. It’s like there is a “learning period,” a “transition period,” and finally, an “implementation period” in the life cycle of becoming a software engineer.

Ultimately, becoming a software engineer is going to be a large investment of your time, energy, and more than you realized, but if you are in it to win it and change your life, then it is going to be pretty transformational.
