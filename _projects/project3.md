## Overview

This client came in as a referral. Their existing website crashed and the developer quit. The initial request was to restore the crashed website. I worked with their web host provider and restored their website to the most recent backup on file since the source code was unavailable. Afterwards, the client wanted some updates to their website (which is built in Wordpress) and I sketched a template of their site since there was some interest in updating the design. 

## Design Process
I gathered some website data regarding their existing website and provided a recommended assessment including performance optimization with page speed recommendations (the site ranked a 30/100 on desktop and a 5/100 on mobile), design recommendations for aesthetics and web accessibility, a competitor analysis, and recommendations for improving SEO. I drafted a web proposal and after approval, I began a site map and templating the layout of the client's website. Following another meeting, the client decided that they wanted to keep their existing website.

## Code Process
The primary goal was to bring their current Wordpress site up to date, so I went through their c-panel and updated their prices, menu items, hours of operation, and images to be relevant. I also cleaned the code aesthetically since their were some blank holders acting as padding and began adding text to alt tags since they were blank and this would benefit their SEO.

The secondary goal was to update the entire site to be modern and mobile friendly and the client was interested in a particular layout from another website. I sourced images from the client's Wordpress site, and I began the layout process to create a hierarchy and consistency across the pages. 

## Key Takeaways
1. Sometimes it is better to start small & work with sections of an existing site
2. Building a brand new website costs not just their resources, but yours too 
3. Make sure that you schedule deliverables and have a sign off at each point before proceeding

** I learned **
* I learned how to structure my elements so that I am using the same element across the pages, but targeting with different classes 
* This site is mobile friendly - everything builds off itself with media queries
* The navigation bar has a matching border around the elements, but the border changes color when hovered over
* The food and drink menu's are using reusable code with float left and float right classes
