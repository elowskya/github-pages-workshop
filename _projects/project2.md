## Overview

I met this client at a Tech Talk Meetup being hosted by one of the local colleges. He was new to San Diego and had an existing IT business website that needed to be modernized. 

## The Design Process

The client was particularly inspired by another IT company website on the East Coast, so the goal was to follow their homepage layout and source images for his site. 

## The Coding Process

Coding this website was a little more challenging since it involved background images with a lot of absolute and relative positioning in order to have the light blue overlay and text which the client liked. In addition, this client wanted to migrate from their existing web host provider to another, so there was a period of time where we compared other web providers and features offered and discussed how this would impact him scaling his other websites in the future. 

## Key Takeaways from this Project
1. The time spent discussing web host providers, site configuration, and researching is an additional service.
2. Logos, branding, image sourcing, and content development are also an additional service.
3. When working with a client, determine if they have a clear list and explanation of services they want to offer.
4. When in doubt, build a Wordpress site.

* Not shown here, but this site was coded and then set up with Wordpress
* Wordpress installation and configuration of admin accounts and emails
* Setup of SSL certificates and use of plugin to render site as "https" versus "http"
* Use of ninja forms plugin to create a contact form and confirmed end points
