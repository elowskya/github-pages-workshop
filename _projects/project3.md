## Overview

This client came in as a referral. Their existing website crashed and the developer quit. The initial request was to restore the crashed website. I worked with their web host provider and restored their website to the most recent backup on file since the source code was unavailable. Afterwards, the client wanted some updates to their website (which is built in Wordpress) and I sketched a template of their site since there was some interest in updating the design. 

## Design Process
I gathered some website data regarding their existing website and provided a recommended optimization assessment including improving performance optimization with page speed recommendations, design recommendations for aesthetics, a competitor analysis, and recommendations for improving SEO. I drafted a web proposal and after approval, I began a site map and templating the layout of the client's website. Following another meeting, the client decided that they wanted to keep their existing website.

## Code Process
The primary goal was to bring their current Wordpress site up to date, so I went through their c-panel and updated information including images and menus since the prices and menu items had since changed and I also went through and began adding text to alt tags since they were blank.

The secondary goal was to update the entire site to be modern and mobile friendly and the client was interested in a certain type of layout from another website. I didn't have the source code from the developer, so I had to go through the client's Wordpress site to source images, and begin the layout process to make code consistent across the pages. The menus are utilizing floats to become single column for mobile and they are double column for desktop.

** Things that I learned **
* I learned how to structure my elements so that I am using the same element across the pages, but targeting with different classes 
* This site is mobile friendly - everything builds off itself with media queries
* The navigation bar has a matching border around the elements, but the border changes color when hovered over
* The food and drink menu's are using reusable code with float left and float right classes

## Key Takeaways from this Project
1. Make sure that you and your client are on the same page - building a brand new website costs not just their resources, but yours too
2. Sometimes it is better to just work with what you have. Small changes add up over time. 
3. Make sure that you schedule deliverables and have a sign off at each deliverable, so that you and your client stay on the same page
