## Overview

Katy's site was one of the first websites that I was asked to build. She had been teaching classes for years and decided that she wanted another
avenue for clients to connect with her.

## The Design Process
We met remotely and discussed how she would like her website to feel and if there were any websites that she already liked so I could get an idea of what 
she was looking for which ultimately was a light, crisp, and hollistic theme with plants. We met a few times remotely with the initial presentation being a little too heavy in plants and needing more balance to being a little too dark and corporate feeling and now to finally splashes of pink, beige, and green. 

## The Code Process
This site is built in Bootstrap, so using the syntax from their library was critical to mobile responsiveness in the html files. When working with the CSS files, I used gradients, opacity, and a fixed background attachment to give the site color for branding and to make it visually appealing, but not too much where it is distracting from the message. Also, when it came time to adding a subscription form, I used Formspree.io, which uses a capcha to decrease spam. Thereafter, I learned how to host a static website on Heroku and that you can name part of the url provided it isn't already taken.

**Things I learned:**

* Building a single page desktop site and mobile friendly site in Bootstrap.
* A lot of ways to potentially display images on a website between background attachments, borders, grid layout...
* Testing cross browser using the developer tools and when the site is live to verify it displays and functions the way I meant for it to do.
* How to host a static website on Heroku


## Key Takeaways from this Project

1. I would recommend coming to a client with a few templates that you have personally coded already on hand for any "quick projects."
2. If you are building a website from scratch, I would advise the client to have a file of images, content, logo, and anything else they want on their site ready for you.
3. Know ahead of time if your client wants you to maintain their code, or if they want to use a CMS to update their own site after it is live and running.
