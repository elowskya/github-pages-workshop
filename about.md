So I guess this is the part where I tell you that I like
yoga, dogs, and craft beer...

Let's not do that:

* Instead, let's be a little real, but not get too comfortable.

My background is non traditional. I'm a first generation college student. I initially attended a Community College since it was free for me due to government funding and my grandmother was going to let me live with her. I took classes that interested me including: Business, Sciences, Math, and 
of course Yoga. When it came time to finish, I chose Kinesiology since I figured every one needs to move in order to live (or eat - I also considered Dietetics). I graduated from Grand Valley State University with a Bachelor's of Science degree in Exercise Science with the highlights including working with the Special Olympics Basketball program and an intership in Cardiovascular Rehabilitation. Thereafter, I worked as a Fitness Program Director and a Corporate Wellness Program Manager. I realized that I was becoming an expert in my field when it comes to program optimization and KPI's; however, I also realized that long term, I am hungry to keep learning and challenging myself.

It was bold, but I quit my Corporate Management position and traveled to California and enrolled into a Full Stack Coding Bootcamp. This bootcamp was the hardest thing I have ever done. I am used to being the role model and person where everyone asks for advice. I was definitley not at the top of my class here. I kept practicing my code and watching videos and reading about blog posts on code. I even went through almost all of my assignments and resubmitted them. I am ever grateful to the instructor and TA's for their patience.

Web development is a skill. There's a technical aspect that takes a little time to start to acclimate your brain in thinking in terms of objects, loops, and really just the process of accessing information and moving it around. Even coding for hours takes time to build mental endurance. After completing my Coding Bootcamp, I quickly found a couple of clients who wanted website work. Working with clients freelance, is also a skill which involves an incredible amount of communication and drive to find answers and troubleshoot your own code. I can definitely say that I have learned a lot. I still take classes (online and in person) and each project I take on, I learn something new and become better. 

I am excited to share this part of my journey with you.
