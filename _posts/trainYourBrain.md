## Train Your Brain

Everytime you want to quit. Push a little harder. Train your brain to find crevices of ways to think that you wouldn’t have first thought of.

I’m training myself and my brain to not give up. For almost two years now, I have been adding myself to relevant networking groups, email groups, free online tutorials, taking extra classes, reading blogs, taking quizzes, and pretty much getting involved with everything I can get my hands on. Everytime I wonder how something is done, I start searching online and compare ways and try it out. One of the very first things I taught myself was how to purchase a domain through a host provider and use FTP to upload my code to see a public website that I created. Even during this learning process, I had to learn about picking a good domain name, comparing different tools that could provide FTP and decide which one to use. I had to learn about using a c-panel and troubleshoot to learn about uploading absolute links in order to display my images. Thereafter, I decided I wanted to learn to host a site on AWS and had to read documentation to successfully host another website using S3 buckets. I’ve rabbit-holed into some things, but overall, it’s starting to add up. 

The point is, I needed to start somewhere and this was the most obvious to me. You need to keep finding things to build and problems to solve. Train your brain and push a little harder when you want to give up and keep doing things that align with your values. It takes time.
