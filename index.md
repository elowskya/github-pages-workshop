**It's more of a journey than anything...** As a web developer it is more process based than what one may think upon the surface, but then if you think about it, every thing in life is really a process. 

## What I do

Every day I code web sites for freelance. That process has evolved from me taking on free clients (which I'll blog about not doing this soon), to having a slowly growing base of clients & projects. 

## How does this help you?

I am so glad you asked, because I will be blogging about a year's worth of not necessarily failures, but some really useful tips and tutorials on becoming a better programmer and how to better position yourself when it comes to working with clients so you take on realistic projects and turn real time results which will provide value to both you and your client.

Also, if you are interested in collaborating, reach out. The internet and TeamViewer are a click away!
