## Overview

I met this client at a Tech Talk Meetup being hosted by one of the local colleges. He was new to San Diego and had an existing IT business website that needed to be modernized. 

## The Design Process

The client was particularly inspired by another IT company website on the East Coast, so the goal was to follow their homepage layout and source images for his site. 

## The Coding Process

Coding this website was a little more challenging since it involved background images with a lot of absolute and relative positioning in order to have the light blue overlay and text which the client liked. In addition, this client wanted to migrate from their existing web host provider to another, so there was a period of time where we compared other web providers and features offered and discussed how this would impact him scaling his other websites in the future. 

**Things that I learned** 
* How to code a website without a library to call, so pure HTML and CSS
* Using media queries and the developer tools to check for responsiveness
* Use of the Z-index and how to make drop down menus
* How to make the slider appear animated with the dots in html and css

## Key Takeaways from this Project
1. Content development is an additional service.
2. Logos, branding, and image sourcing are also an additional service.
3. When in doubt, build a Wordpress site.
