My career began with 5 years experience in Program Management. In 2018, I moved to San Diego, California to increase my technical skill set in software development; I enrolled in a full stack bootcamp at UCSD Extension which taught the MERN stack. Afterwards, I have kept the ball rolling, by getting involved in the coding community, with projects, some client work, and I am working on my Master's degree in Computer Science with National University. 

Every day, I continue to challenge myself and hone my skill.
